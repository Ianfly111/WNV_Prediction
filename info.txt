West nile outbreak May to December.

At the highest tested temperature, mean adult longevity did not exceed 12 days for both sexes and thus makes impossible the risk of WNV transmission.

After a mosquito bites a person, the female mosquito can live for 100 days and they can lay hundreds of eggs during their lifespan.
